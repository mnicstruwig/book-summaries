<li>"Lean Startup" comes from lean manufacturing revolution by Taiichi Ohno and
Shigeo Shingo at Toyota.</li>
<li>Goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build &#x2013; the thing
customers want and will pay for &#x2013; as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>"Lean startup" is a new way of looking at the development of innovative new
products with an emphasis on fast iteration, customer insight, vision and
ambition (simultaneously)</li>
<li><i>Engine of growth</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every new version of product, feature or marketing program &#x2013;&gt; attempt to
improve the engine of growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Vision</i> &#x2013;&gt; destination in mind for the startup.</li>
<li>Vision is achieved by executing a <i>Strategy</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>business model, product road map, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Product</i> &#x2013;&gt; result of the strategy.</li>
<li><i>Tuning the engine</i> &#x2013;&gt; products change constantly through the process of
optimization.</li>
<li><i>Pivot</i> &#x2013;&gt; When the strategy has to change.

<li><i>Product</i> &#x2013;&gt; (broad definition used) any source of value for the people

<li>Usually bigger companies are good at <i>sustaining innovation</i> (incremental
improvement), but they're bad at <i>disruptive innovation</i> (breakthrough new
products).</li>
<li>Cultivating entrepreneurship is the responsibility of senior management.</li>
<li>The amount of time a company can count on holding on to market leadership
to exploit its earlier innovation is shrinking.</li>

that uses Lean Startup techniques to create disruptive innovations
continuously.</li>

<li>Learn which elements of strategy are working</li>

<li>Strategy is based on assumptions</li>

should be to test them as soon as possible.</li>
<li>First challenge &#x2013;&gt; build an organization that can test assumptions systematically</li>
<li>Second challenge &#x2013;&gt; perform rigorous testing without losing sight of
company's vision.</li>
<li>First step in understanding a new product or service &#x2013;&gt; is it
<i>value-creating</i> or <i>value-destroying</i>?</li>
<li><i>Success theater</i> &#x2013;&gt; using the appearance of growth to make it seem you're

<li><i>genchi gembutsu</i> &#x2013;&gt; "go and see for yourself". Saying from Toyota, which
means that business decision should be based on first-hand knowledge. It is
unacceptable to take things for granted or to rely on the reports of others.</li>
<li><i>Get out of the building</i> &#x2013;&gt; entrepreneurs need extensive contact with
potential customers to understand them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You need to confirm that your leap-of-faith questions are based in
reality; that the customer has a significant problem worth solving</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Early contact with customers is to clarify basic, coarse-level assumptions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Understand what problems the customer has.</li>
<li>Leads to <i>customer archetype</i> &#x2013;&gt; short document that humanizes proposed
target customer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No amount of design can anticipate the complexities of bringing a product
to life in the real world.</li>
<li>Two issues to avoid:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Building immediately with only a few customer conversations &#x2013;&gt;
Customers don't know what they really want, so you're deluding yourself.</li>
<li>Analysis paralysis &#x2013;&gt; endlessly refining their plans.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The problem with most entrepreneurs' plans is that their assumptions are
<i>wrong</i>, not their underlying strategic principles.</li>

<li>An MVP helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>It's the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop
with the minimum amount of effort (not necessarily the smallest product!)</li>
<li>MVP &#x2013;&gt; Begins the process of learning.</li>
<li>When in doubt, simplify your MVP &#x2013; people tend to overestimate features required.</li>
<li>Any additional work (beyond what is needed to start learning) is a waste.</li>

<li>Even "low-quality" MVPs can help build a great high-quality product.</li>

<li>Customers only care if it serves their needs, not how long something took
to build.</li>

contribute directly to learning.</li>

accelerate through the Build-Measure-Learn loop faster than anyone else.</li>

</ol></li>
<li>Traditional product improvement doesn't apply to startups &#x2013;&gt; if you're
building the wrong thing, optimizing the product does not lead to success.</li>
<li>Startups need to measure progress through evidence &#x2013;&gt; can only be assessed

<li>Pivot requires keeping the context of what you've learned so far, while
also making a fundamental change in strategy to seek even greater validated
learning.</li>
<li>Telltale signs to pivot: decreasing effectiveness of product experiments +
general feeling that product development should be more productive.</li>
<li>Recommended that every startup has a regular "pivot or persevere" scheduled
meeting.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Participation of product development <i>and</i> business leadership</li>
<li>Product development &#x2013;&gt; bring complete report of results in product

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf1ddac1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Small batches &#x2013;&gt; quality issues are identified sooner.</li>
<li>And what happens when you discover you're building the wrong product?</li>
<li>Small batches minimize time, money and effort that ends up being wasted.</li>
<li>Small batches allow us to move through the build-measure-learn loop faster
than competitors.</li>
<li><i>large-batch death spiral</i> &#x2013;&gt; large batches grow over time, as moving a
batch forward requires additional work + rework, which introduces delays
and interruptions. This incentivises everyone to work in even larger
batches to minimize overhead. <b>Be very careful / wary of this</b>.</li>
<li>As soon as you formulate a hypothesis you want to test, product development
team should be engineered to design and run the experiment ASAP using the
smallest possible batch size.</li>
<li>Planning for build-measure-learn happens in reverse: figure out what we
need to learn &#x2013;&gt; what we need to measure &#x2013;&gt; what we need to build.</li>
<li>As a result, it is not the customer but our <i>hypothesis about the customer</i>
that pulls work from product development and other functions. Anything else
is <i>waste</i>.</li>
<li>Lean Startup only works if you can build an organization that is as
adaptable / fast as the challenges it faces</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sustainable growth characterized by "New customers come from the actions of
past customers"</li>
<li>Four ways customers drive sustainable growth:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Word of mouth</b></li>
<li><b>As side effect of product usage</b> &#x2013;&gt; eg. car, fashion, phone, etc.
Awareness is driven by usage.</li>
<li><b>Funded advertising</b> &#x2013;&gt; For this to be sustainable, advertising must be
funded by revenue. Cost of acquiring customer &lt; revenue generated by
customer. This marginal profit is used to attract more customers (the
more you have, the faster it goes)</li>
<li><b>Repeat purchase or use</b> &#x2013;&gt; eg. subscription services, consumables</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Engines of Growth</i> &#x2013;&gt; the faster the loop turns, the faster the company
will grow.</li>
<li><p>
Engines of growth help gives startups a subset of metrics on which to focus
their energy.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Start-ups don't starve, they drown" (in a sea of ideas)
&#x2014; Shawn Carolan.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>Most ideas only make a difference at the margins</li>
<li><b>Sticky engine of growth</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rely on high customer retention. Once you start using the product, you
will continue to use the product.</li>
<li>Need to track the churn rate very carefully.</li>
<li>customer acquisition rate &gt; churn rate &#x2013;&gt; growth</li>
<li>Number of customers / revenue per customer is almost irrelevant as a
metric for this engine of growth (since it has no impact on growth).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Viral engine of growth</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Awareness spreads from person to person rapidly.</li>
<li>Growth happens as a side-effect of product use (word-of-mouth not necessary)</li>
<li>Companies must focus on increasing the viral "coefficient" as much as possible.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Consequence: typically don't charge customers directly, but rely on advertising.</li>
<li>Monetary exchange does not drive growth &#x2013;&gt; only an indicator the users
value product enough to pay.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Paid engine of growth</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lifetime value of customer - cost of acquiring that customer = growth</li>
<li>Increase rate of growth by increasing revenue from each customer, or
reducing cost of acquiring each customer.</li>
<li>Most sources of customer acquisition come with competition.</li>
<li>This means that competitors will bid into the marginal profit that you
depend on for growth.</li>
<li>Therefore long-term growth requires ability to monetize certain customers in
multiple ways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Engine of growth &#x2013;&gt; determines product / market fit</li>
<li>If you're asking whether you've achieved product / market fit, you haven't.</li>
<li>Eventually every engine of growth runs out, since you're tied to a given
set of customers that end up being exhausted.</li>
<li>This is what provokes crises in companies who's engines of growth have run
their course, and they don't have incubation projects ready to find the
next engine of growth.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org49cf550" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org49cf550">11. Adapt</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org49cf550">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Adaptive organization</i> &#x2013;&gt; automatically adjusts process and performance
to current conditions.</li>
<li>You can't trade quality for time. If you're experiencing quality problems
now, the resulting defects will slow you down later.</li>
<li>Build-Measure-Learn loop is continuous, so shortcuts taken in product
quality, design or infrastructure today end up slowing the company
down tomorrow.</li>
<li>Need an adaptive process. Going too fast == problems. Invest in preventing
the problems that waste time. Once resolved, you naturally speed up.</li>
<li>Until companies can justify return on the investment (which is impossible
&#x2013;&gt; unknown cost and unknown gain), they do nothing.</li>
<li><i>Five Whys</i> &#x2013;&gt; Ask the question "Why?" five times to understand the <b>root</b>
cause of problems. This ties investment to the prevention of most symptoms.</li>
<li>Make proportional investment to fix the symptoms at each phase of the five
whys. Minor glitch &#x2013;&gt; minor investment.</li>
<li>Five Whys regulates speed &#x2013;&gt; more problems, more investment to solve them.
It settles on an optimal pace for the team. Works great with small batches!</li>
<li>Be wary of the five "blames" trap &#x2013;&gt; frustrated teammates begin trying to find
blame, rather than understand root cause. We're trying to find objective
truth about chronic problems caused by a bad process. <i>Not</i> bad people.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make sure everyone affected by problem is in the room during analysis of
the problem.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Include anyone who discovered / diagnosed the problem.</li>
<li>Include anyone who tried to fix the symptom.</li>
<li>Include anyone who worked on the feature / subsystem.</li>
<li>If issue was escalated to senior management, people who were involved in
escalation should be included.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Usually, whoever is left out becomes target for blame.</li>
<li>Mantra &#x2013;&gt; "If mistakes happen, shame on us for making it so easy to make
that mistake"</li>
<li><b>Don't be tempted to save time by sparing busy people from the root cause analysis!</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Five Whys tips (especially starting out):
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rules: 1. Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time. 2. Never allow same
mistake to be made twice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Crucial when teams are under "too much" pressure, when there are
calls for investments in preventing problems that cost time and money, etc.
that someone with sufficient authority is present to insist the process be
followed and implemented.</li>
<li>Need to have buy-in for the process to work. Otherwise rely on 2-rule system.</li>
<li>When introducing Five Whys, start with small low-stakes symptoms to relieve pressure.</li>
<li>Consider implementing a simple rule that's easy to follow that will automatically trigger a Five
Whys meeting.</li>
<li>Don't radically change anything &#x2013;&gt; remember, proportional investment.
Short, simple meetings with simple changes.</li>
<li>Use a moderator / "Five Whys Master" to run session. Must have seniority to
ensure assignments get done &#x2013;&gt; take accountability.</li>
<li>Organizations have "muscle memory" &#x2013;&gt; it's going to be difficult to
unlearn past habits and ways of work.</li>
<li>Need to change the mindset / culture to become Adaptive, but it's not enough.</li>
<li>You <i>also</i> need to treat work as a system + tune the batch size (Chapter 9)</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org37384ff">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Myth: Companies lose capacity for innovation, creativity and growth when
they become large.</li>
<li>Management philosophy change &#x2013;&gt; <i>portfolio thinking</i></li>
<li>Startup teams need 1. scarce but secure resources, 2. independent authority
to develop their business, 3. personal stake in the outcome.</li>
<li><b>1. Scarce but secure resources</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For startups, too much budget is as harmful as too little</li>
<li>But they're extremely sensitive to mid-course changes.</li>
<li>Startups &#x2013;&gt; less capital required, but it must be 100% secure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>2. Independent development authority</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Must be able to conceive and execute experiments without seeking
excessive number of approvals</li>
<li>Recommended to be 100% cross-functional (full-time members from each
department) &#x2013;&gt; must be able to ship functioning products (not just
prototypes!)</li>
<li>Scary for parent organization (hence, personal stake)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>3. Personal stake in the outcome</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stock options if private company, bonuses if in parent company tied to
long-term success.</li>
<li>Reputation can also be at stake &#x2013;&gt; give major credit if it's a success.</li>
<li>Critical that the criteria of success are crystal clear, and not based on
the whims of senior management.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take serious care to protect established business from internal startup &#x2013;&gt;
sabotage is a rational response when managers become threatened.</li>
<li>Transparency is important, don't hide innovation in a black box &#x2013;&gt;
causes feelings of betrayal, paranoia and politics as managers become
incentivized to detect and smoke out threats to their position.</li>
<li>Criticism is aimed at senior executives &#x2013;&gt; dishonesty will
naturally cause this kind of response in managers.</li>
<li><i>Innovation sandbox</i>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Any team can create true split-test experiment that affects only the
sandboxed part of product / service</li>
<li>One team sees experiment through from beginning to end.</li>
<li>No experiment can run longer than the specified amount of time.</li>
<li>No experiment can affect more than a specified number of customers.</li>
<li>Every experiment <i>must</i> be evaluated using a single standard report of
5-10 actionable metrics.</li>
<li>Every team working inside sandbox must use the <b>same metrics</b>.</li>
<li>Any team that creates an experiment must monitor the metrics and
customer reactions while the experiment is in progress. Abort in case of
catastrophe.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Start with a small sandbox</li>
<li>Customers in sandbox are <i>real</i> &#x2013;&gt; not a concept or market test!</li>
<li>Innovation team should be cross-functional + have a clear leader.</li>
<li>Innovation team should be able to deploy in sandbox without prior
approval + report on success using actionable metrics</li>
<li>True experiments easy to label success / failure &#x2013;&gt; they move top-level
metrics or they don't &#x2013;&gt; immediate learning.</li>
<li>Small batches + fast feedback loop &#x2013;&gt; teams converge to optimal solutions
rapidly, even if starting from bad ideas</li>
<li>Internal start-up teams follow the same accountability as a normal startup:
build an ideal model based on customer archetypes &#x2013;&gt; launch MVP &#x2013;&gt;
establish baseline &#x2013;&gt; Tune engine</li>
<li>Problem: employees follow products they develop as the move from startup
&#x2013;&gt; optimization + growth &#x2013;&gt; legacy.</li>
<li>This means strong creative managers wind up in the optimization and growth
phases instead of innovation!</li>
<li>Solution: when a product moves between phases, have a hand-off
between teams (where employees can choose to move, or stay to build
something new).</li>
<li>Internal entrepreneurs should be allowed to operate within organizations
&#x2013;&gt; keep them accountable with innovation accounting.</li>
<li>As you find success, grow the sandbox over time.</li>
<li>Senior management should strongly consider whether sandbox teams are
able to defend themselves politically &#x2013;&gt; any growing of the sandbox <i>must</i>
consider this.</li>
<li>At some point, sandbox grows to the point where it becomes the status
quo &#x2013;&gt; restart the cycle again (usually when it has grown to encompass the
whole product). <b>This is hard for innovators to accept!</b></li>
<li>What happens when "Lean startup" becomes the status quo?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't be dogmatic.</li>
<li>But don't compromise and split the difference either.</li>
<li>Subject each new idea to the same concept of scientific hypothesis-testing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hypothesis &#x2013;&gt; MVP &#x2013;&gt; Measure &#x2013;&gt; Learn &#x2013;&gt; repeat</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adopt a new way of working &#x2013;&gt; tempting to blame this new
system for problems. Sometimes true, sometimes not.</li>
<li>Must be able to predict the outcome of your changes in order to tell if the problems
are really problems.</li>
<li>Lean start up optimizes the build-measure-learn feedback loop (i.e.
validated learning), <i>not</i> individual productivity. In fact, it may require
sub-optimizing individual functions.</li>
<li>It's not about building fast. Or measuring fast. It's about completing the
<b>loop</b> fast.</li>
<li>This means switching to validated learning <i>feels worse</i> at first.</li>
<li>So useful to set expectation (day one!) &#x2013;&gt; loss of productivity is inevitable as part
of transition.</li>
<li>Lean startup is a framework &#x2013;&gt; Remember five whys and adaptability.</li>
